# Satellite-Thermal-Fault-Detector
A real-world fault detection system built using NASA satellite telemetry. This project analyzes spacecraft sensor data, visualizes thermal behavior over time, and flags subsystem anomalies using rule-based logic â€” laying the groundwork for future AI-assisted space health monitoring.
